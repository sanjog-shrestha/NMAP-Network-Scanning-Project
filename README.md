# üîç NMAP Network Scanning Project

## üß† Project Goals

This project demonstrates core competencies in network reconnaissance using **NMAP**, a powerful and widely-used network scanning tool. The goal is to:

* Identify live hosts, open ports, services, OS information, and potential vulnerabilities
* Practice ethical, permission-based scanning
* Produce professional reports with actionable insights
* Showcase real-world cybersecurity investigation skills

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

Each phase of the project covers a specific NMAP scanning technique. All scans were performed on a private, controlled lab environment.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Ethical Disclaimer**: All scans were conducted on networks and systems that I own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized scanning is illegal and unethical.

### 1. üì° Basic Network Discovery

```
nmap -sn 192.168.233.0/24
```

* **Purpose**: Discover all live hosts within the local subnet.
* **Result**: Returned list of active IP addresses and associated MAC addresses.

*Sample Output Screenshot:*

### 2. üîç Port Scanning (SYN Scan)

```
nmap -sS -T4 192.168.233.137
```

* **Purpose**: Detect open TCP ports on 192.168.233.137
* **Scan Type**: Stealth SYN scan with aggressive timing (`-T4`)
* **Result**: Identified services like SSH (22), HTTP (80), and HTTPS (443)

*Sample Output Screenshot:*

### 3. üß¨ Service and OS Detection

```
nmap -sV -O 192.168.233.137
```

* **Purpose**: Determine running service versions and OS fingerprint
* **Result**: Services with versions (e.g., Apache 2.2.8), OS guess (e.g., Linux 2.6.X)

*Security Insight*: Older versions of services might be vulnerable to known CVEs.

*Sample Output Screenshot:*

### 4. üö® Vulnerability Scanning

```
nmap --script vuln 192.168.233.137
```

* **Purpose**: Run vulnerability NSE scripts against target host
* **Result**: Identified potential CVEs tied to outdated services

*Security Insight*: Detected vulnerabilities included possible CVEs related to outdated SSL versions.

*Sample Output Screenshot:*

### 5. ‚öîÔ∏è Advanced Scanning Techniques (Aggressive Scan)

```
nmap -A -T4 192.168.233.137
```

* **Purpose**: Perform a full aggressive scan combining:

  * OS detection
  * Version detection
  * Script scanning
  * Traceroute
* **Result**: Comprehensive fingerprint of the target

*Security Insight*: This scan offers a full attacker-view of the system; very useful for red-teaming.

## üìä Findings Summary

| IP Address      | Service      | Detected Version | Vulnerability (CVE) | Description                              |
| --------------- | ------------ | ---------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 192.168.233.137 | vsFTPd       | 2.3.4            | CVE-2011-2523       | Backdoor                                 |
| 192.168.233.137 | SSL          | 3.0              | CVE-2014-2455       | Information Leak                         |

## üîê Security Implications

* Unnecessary open ports increase attack surface
* Service version exposure aids attackers in fingerprinting
* Outdated services can be targeted with known exploits
* Lack of segmentation could allow lateral movement

## üßæ Conclusion

Through this project, I demonstrated key scanning techniques using NMAP. Each stage provided practical insights into host discovery, service enumeration, and vulnerability detection. The hands-on experience enhanced my understanding of how attackers probe networks‚Äîand how defenders can detect and mitigate exposure.
